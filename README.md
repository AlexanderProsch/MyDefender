# MyDefender
This was a project in my first year of Epitech and was therefore coded in C.<br/>
I coded this project together with my fellow student Johannes Timmreck in a span of two weeks.<br/>
For a succesfull compilation, the csfml library is required.<br/>
Use the Makefile to compile all the code with GCC by typing "make re", the binary name will be "my_defender".<br/>
To launch the game simply execute the binary, instructions on how to play the game will be shown<br/>
in the game itself.<br/>
